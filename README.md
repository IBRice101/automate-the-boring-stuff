# Automate the Boring Stuff with Python

On July 1st the Udemy course for [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) became free with a coupon, so I decided to have a little crack at it

A lot of the earlier stuff is (as you can imagine) sorta dull for someone who's been programming for... however long I've been doing it now, but still it seems like a pretty invaluable resource as the course goes on, especially for someone who hates boring stuff lol.

Thanks to Al Sweigart, the author.
